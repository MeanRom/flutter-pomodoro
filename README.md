# TM | Pomodoro
*A small but mighty productivity app that might just help you (and me) stay focused, get work done, and actually finish those projects sitting in your todo-list.*

This started as a simple app experiment, but the goal is to grow it into something bigger over time — including integration with a separate todo-list project to make task management less painful than v1.

## ❓ Why this app?

As an (almost) graduated Bachelor MCT Next Web Development student at Howest, I’ve struggled with staying focused and productive during projects.  

In my (very limited) free time, I started building small apps to help myself — and the idea is to eventually combine them into a larger system. That way, I don’t need ten different tools and services to manage the same workflow over and over again.  

👉 Inspiration: Think of it as my own mini-version of **Odoo**.

## 💻 Why only iOS, macOS, and Web?

You might wonder: *“Why no Linux, Android, or Windows support?”*  

Simple: I don’t use those platforms for my professional work. Since this app started as a personal productivity tool, I focused on the platforms I actually use daily.  

That said — this repo is meant as a **base recipe**.  
If you’d like a Pomodoro version for Linux, Android, or Windows, feel free to use this as a starting point and adapt it to your needs.  
**Think of it as the recipe — you can cook your own dish from it.** 🍳
