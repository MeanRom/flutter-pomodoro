## üß≠ About This Project

This started as a simple experiment to build a productivity app for myself. My goal is to grow it into a larger system, eventually integrating it with a separate to-do list project to make task management easier.

## ü§ù Forking and Contributions

This project is **open source**, but with a specific purpose. You are **welcome to fork this repository** to use the code as a **template** to build your own version.

However, since this is a personal project I'll be actively developing, I am **not accepting external contributions at this time.** This approach allows me to maintain a clear vision and update the project on my own schedule.

I will be adding new features and updates throughout the year, so feel free to pull those changes into your own projects\!

## üì¶ Planned Features

  - [ ] To-do list grouping
  - [ ] Manually adjustable timer cycles
  - [ ] Sync between devices (iOS & macOS only)
  - [ ] ...and plenty of small tweaks along the way\!

## ‚ùì Why This App?

As a student of full-stack development, I've often struggled with staying focused. This app is a personal tool I built to help myself, and the idea is to eventually combine it with other small apps into a larger, cohesive system. My goal is to create an integrated workflow so I don't need a bunch of different tools to manage my tasks.

In a way, you can think of it as my own mini-version of **Odoo**.

## üíª Platforms: iOS, macOS, and Web

You might wonder: *"Why no Linux, Android, or Windows support?"*

The simple reason is that I don't use those platforms for my professional work. Since this app started as a personal productivity tool, I focused on the platforms I use daily.

Think of this repository as a **base recipe.** If you need a version for Linux, Android, or Windows, you can use this as a starting point and adapt it to your needs. **You have the recipe; you can cook your own dish from it.** üç≥
