## üß≠ About This Project

This started as a simple experiment to build a productivity app for myself. My goal is to grow it into a larger system, eventually integrating it with a separate to-do list project to make task management easier.

## ü§ù Forking and Contributions

This project is **open source**, but with a specific purpose. You are **welcome to fork this repository** to use the code as a **template** to build your own version.

However, I'm **not accepting external contributions at this time.** This approach allows me to maintain a clear vision and update the project on my own schedule.

I will be adding new features and updates throughout the year, so feel free to pull those changes into your own projects\!

## üì¶ Planned Features

  - [ ] To-do list grouping
  - [ ] Manually adjustable timer cycles
  - [ ] Sync between devices (iOS & macOS only)
  - [ ] ...and plenty of small tweaks along the way\!

## ‚ùì Why This App?

As a student of full-stack development, I've often struggled with staying focused. This app is a personal tool I built to help myself, and the idea is to eventually combine it with other small apps into a larger, cohesive system. My goal is to create an integrated workflow so I don't need a bunch of different tools to manage my tasks.

In a way, you can think of it as my own mini-version of **Odoo**.
